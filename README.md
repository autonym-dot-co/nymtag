# Nymtag - a nametag for the Internet

Legacy identity systems are fundamentally insecure. Legal identities are easily compromised, driver's licenses overdisclose personal information, certificate authorities do not provide meaningful security, domain names can be seized by registrars at-will, and people are often forced to create new identities for every online service they use, or else compromise their privacy by using a "social sign on" service which only serves to give more control to massively centralized data silos. 

A new kind of identity system is needed, one that respects a user's autonomy rather than compromising it. This identity system would give users full control of their identity and have them interact with each other as peers in a distributed network rather than spokes attached to a centralized control hub. 

Nymtag is a distributed identity management application that uses blockchain technology to give users control of their digital identity. The application combines the Autonym protocol with a trust graph visualization tool to help users determine the trustworthiness of other users on the network, in general or within certain contexts. 

Nymtag is part of an ecosystem of products designed to give people control of their digital identity and personal data.
